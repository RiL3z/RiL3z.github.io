# The Square Root of 2
The idea is to explore mathematics from the simple perspective of trying to understand the exact number of sqrt(2).

## With this simple problem you can explore:
- All the different classes of numbers (integers, rational numbers, natural numbers, nested hierarchies).
- Addition, and by extension, multiplication.
- How to think about what it means to multiply non-integer numbers
- Why writing down sqrt(2) is difficult
- Symbols and what they represent
- Algorithms, methods, and approximations

# I'm a Toxic Man
I admire those who have gained the skills to become effective hunters, lumberjacks, sailors, hikers, bikers, climbers, and warriors.

I respect a man who you do not want to fuck with physically. I admire a man who takes the care of his body seriously with good food and exercise.

I'll tell you what I think regardless of the potential consequences. I don't care if your a manager or leader and there's pressure to express myself in a certain way. I don't care about making people uncomfortable. If there's something that I think is important to say, I'll say it, and it will come out unfiltered.

I'll tell you I'm fine when I'm not. I'll tell you I'm not afraid when I am. I'll tell you I don't hurt when I do. I'll tell you I'm not angry when I am. I'll tell you I don't need help when I do. Why? Is it because I'm trying to put up a fa√ßade of resiliency so you'll think I'm the man? Am I just lying to you so you think I'm tough? No. It's because when you hurt, the best thing you can do to develop your toughness is to convince yourself, "No, I don't hurt. This ain't shit. Give me more." By saying to someone else or to yourself that your fine when your feel bad, you actually start to believe it. When you believe that your fine just after feeling really bad, you're tougher. Your tolerance for pain and mental struggle just went up a small notch. I think that's fucking awesome!

Getting laid is a game of persuasion. Hot girls expect guys to chase them and men try to win their favor with their status and exploits.

I'm value peace and quiet so I can focus on my work. If I want to seriously focus on something, I lock myself in a room where I cannot be disturbed.

I think it's healthier for me to analyze my own emotional problems and ponder about how to handle them rather than burdening someone else by complaining about my problems to others in the hope that they understand and will give me some solid advice. When it comes to my emotions I have the final say.

I purposely make things harder than they need to be. I don't use gloves when I grip the barbell. That's for ninnys. I want my hands to get a little shredded up on the [knurl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knurling) as the bar twists in my hands. I'll go running in blizzard with a sore ankle just for the hell of it. I'll get so focused on writing that I won't eat for a day and a half.

I get together with the boys and we talk shop about sex, politics, and life. We weave into our conversation many a sexist or racist joke. We talk about pussies, bitches, sluts, beauties, assholes, bimbos, whiners, weaklings, fucktards, trophy wives, greaseballs, faggots, hipsters, nerds, wankers, and studs. We'll usually converse over whiskey and, on some special occasions, cigars.

I do not view myself as someone who needs to be 'fixed.' I do view myself as someone who is on a journey to improve himself.

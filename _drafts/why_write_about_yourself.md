Discover who you want to be. Perhaps this is difficult for some but for me, I have a very clear idea about how the man I admire comports himself. Define what that looks like in concrete terms. How would you act, think, and behave in challenging situations if you were the best version of yourself? How would your favorite hero act in a fucked-up scenarios? Invent a person who doesn't exist if you have to.

Assess yourself and HONESTLY evaluate your competencies in the areas of life that you want to be a hero in. Accept the fact that who you currently are and the person you want to be are not the same thing. You may discover that you have a torn a very wide rift in between the person you admire and the person that you actually are. That's ok. Don't panic. That's normal.

Now, once the flaws have been exposed, you really have just two options. One is to accept that you have flaws, that you're fine with them, and that you'd rather not doing any work to outgrow them. I don't understand why people would make this choice but I do understand that some folks seem to be happy without striving towards something.

The other option is to get to work.

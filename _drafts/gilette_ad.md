Summarize video:
Men ingesting media where bullying, harassment, #metoo, and toxic masculinity are the topics of discussion.
It's a little hard to make out what's blaring on the tv because the sound bytes are all intermangled together but we hear phrases like:
"bullying"
"The metoo movement"
"toxic masculinity"
Narrator: "Is this the best a man can get?"
There's an old gilette ad playing in the background where the man is getting kissed by a beautiful woman and the familiar "A best man can get!" chant plays.
A boy running from bullies busts through the old ad and receives texts such as:
"FREAK!!!"
"Everyone hates you."
"You're such a loser."
"Sissy!"
Narrator: "Is it?"
Narrator: "We can't hide from it."
There's a tv and we see a cartoon where a bunch of guys whistle at a sexy lady. We see a show where a guy grab's his maid's ass. We see a music video with sexy babes and a ripped dudes with their shirts off.
Narrator: "It's been going on far too long."
There are three boys sitting on the couch watching tv.
We're taken to the set of the tv show where the guy was grabbing his maid's ass with an audience that's being told to applaud.
Narrator: "We can't laugh it off."
The ass-grabbing actor is making claws with his hands and saying "Who's your daddy!" and everyone in the studio audience is laughing.
We're in a business meeting room now and there's a man standing at the head of the table who puts his hand on the shoulder of a female colleague and says:
"What I actually think she's trying to say..."
Narrator: "Making the same old excuses."
We see two boys fighting in the back-yard as three man stand in the background watching and grilling. One of them says: "Boys will be boys." Another smiles and confirms what his buddy is saying with the same line: "Boys will be boys."
We see an unending line of grilling men chanting like drones, all in unison: "Boys will be boys will be boys..."
Narrator: "But something finally changed."
We're shown a bunch of news clips at once where the topic being discussed is sexual harassment.
"And there will be no going back." The camera pans over those men in the studio audience who where watching the ass-grabber show.
A man smiles slightly while looking ahead.
"Because we, we believe in the best in men."
We're shown a clip of Terry Crews proclaiming "Men need to hold other men accountable."
We're at what looks to be a pool party music video shoot or some such bullshit with two fucking smoke-shows talking to each other and a guy is looking at one of them and saying "Smile sweety." Our knight in shining armor comes to the rescue and rebukes this guy by saying: "C'mon!" and giving our perpetrator the stare down.
Narrator: "To say the right thing."
There's a beautiful woman walking down the street. There's a man observing her walk by and he begins to walk towards her after she passes.
Narrator: "To act the right way."
Another man observing him walks in front of this guy, places his hand against the other man to stop him, all the while saying: "No no bro, not cool, not cool!"
There's a kid being chased down the street.
Narrator: "Some already are."
There's a man walking with his boy and he takes notice of this chase.
We're in the street and two men shake hands to resolve their differences, it looks like.
There's a dad holding his daughter and telling her "I am strong!" and the daughter repeats the line "I am strong!"
They guy grilling from earlier stops watching the two boys fighting and starts to run over to them and says: "Guys!"
The man who watched the bullies chasing the boy and who is with his son goes over to the bullies to stop them from harassing this kid.
The grill guy looks at the boy who was on top of the other one and says: "That's not how we treat each other, ok?"
The man who stopped the chasing bullies comforts the kid by asking "Are you ok?" and his son stares in admiration of his dad.
Narrator: "Because the boys watching today..." The camera pans to young boys faces.
Narrator: "Will be the men of tomorrow."
The commercial ends with message:
"It's only by challenging ourselves to be more that we can get closer to our best."

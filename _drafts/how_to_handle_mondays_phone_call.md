Captain Devlin is going to call you anytime from 9-5pm on Monday delivering the news if he believes you potentially have what it takes to be an officer in the Marine Corps. This means you have to PAY ATTENTION TO YOUR PHONE. Keep it close.

There are two outcomes to this call. Either he believes you're cut out for the job or not. How are you going to handle the news if he says he has to pass you up?

Be a gracious loser. Accept that there were other applicants who are positioned to lead better than you are. Ask if there's anything you can do to change his mind. If not, accept that. Allow him to explain his reasoning and take his criticism seriously. Remember he does not owe you a damn thing. LISTEN and SPEAK WHEN SPOKEN TO.

Thank him for his time and service regardless of the outcome.

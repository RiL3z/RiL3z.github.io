# The Zone
## Instructions
Talk about people who claim to be in the zone and that the zone exists. Make observations of people who look like they're in the zone. Explore the different ways people in the zone describe what being in the zone is like. Describe your own experiences. Dig deep into what this feeling is. Argue that this feeling cannot be achieved without effort and the belief that your mind, body, and soul are fused together as one in the pursuit of a task. You won't believe in yourself to the point of entering the zone if you don't have complete confidence. In order to build confidence, you have to build competence. Confidence without the accompanying skills is not confidence at all, but arrogance.

# Why Willpower Can't Be Overrated
I was scrolling around on twitter and ran across an article titled [“Why Willpower is overrated”](https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2018/1/15/16863374/willpower-overrated-self-control-psychology). Since I’m obsessed with the concepts of self-control, willpower, and discipline, the article’s headline, “Why Willpower is overrated”, caught my attention. I have long believed that strong willpower is one of the most important things a human can possess. I think it’s hard to overstate how important of a concept it is to me. The claim “Willpower is overrated” runs directly counter that belief, so I was interested to see what I could learn.

These types of articles are always accompanied with a flashy graphic that abstractly represents the point that the author is making. This particular article depicts two guys in suites. Why is it always fucking guys in suites? Neurotic rants aside (although now that I come to think of it, this whole post is one neurotic rant), one of the guys is slouched over, obviously walking at a snail’s pace, and seems to be expending a great amount of effort reaching for a carrot in front of him. The other guy though, oh man, he is sprinting and reaching out toward some ice cream while breaking a new personal speed record. The visual metaphor is obvious. The carrot is less appealing than the ice cream so the slouching-man has to exercise more effortful control to pursue the carrot and that results in him expending all his motivation so he has no energy to run. The running-man is happy to pursue the ice-cream so running after it is easy for him. He’s chasing what he wants impulsively.
Underneath the picture lies a tag-line with the assertion “Relying on Willpower is a recipe for failure.”

First of all, I want to establish a clear idea of what we're talking about when we use a word like "willpower" since this idea is referenced heavily in the article. Let's take a careful look at the definition. There are a great many definitions from various sources that we could use and we could argue all day about which definition is the proper one but, frankly, that's a waste of time. We're going to boil this concept down into something we can understand at a deeper level. Here's the definition that I'm working from, pulled straight from [google](https://www.google.com/search?rlz=1CDGOYI_enUS728US729&hl=en-US&ei=_L0RXJPuJszEjwSq1IPoDg&q=willpower+definition&oq=willpower+definition&gs_l=psy-ab.3..35i39j0l3j0i22i30l6.6150.10240..10498...1.0..4.255.3683.4j22j3....2..0....1..gws-wiz.....6..0i71j0i131i20i263j0i131j0i67j0i131i67j0i20i263j0i22i10i30.qRc4Wv0U9Q0):
```
willpower
control exerted to do something or restrain impulses
```
Let's analyze this carefully and see what we can understand. Usually, when I see an `or` in a sentence, I like to break up that sentence on the `or` because logically, `or` means that we are saying something `or` we are saying something else. So if we inspect the first part of the sentence, the `control exerted to do something` part, we will see that the word `control` is there. Now, to me, `control` is referring to the conscious part of our brains. We are not controlling our heart-rates but we are controlling whether or not we choose to work out. The word `exert` is also there. To me, `exertion` means to expend effort. So the way this first part of the definition translates in my mind is like this:
```
willpower
conscious effort expended by our minds to do something or restrain impulses
```
Now let's go down the rabbit hole further. If I think really hard about this definition, I can see there's an assumption hidden within it. Embedded within this definition is the assumption that some amount of effort or work has to be performed by our minds in order for us to do something or to restrain impulses. Seems reasonable right? But there's one more thing I'd like to tweak before landing on a final understanding. This `or` word in the definition is bothering me. When a normal person speaks of willpower are they really referring to doing something `or` to restrain impulses? I don't get this sense. I'm going to get rid of `or`. So the hard-boiled idea of willpower that I'm working with now looks like this:
```
willpower
conscious work performed by the mind to act against impulses
```
If we look now, I think this definition of willpower makes the most sense. Let's think of an example where this definition of willpower applies. Let's say it's a scorchingly hot day and you're walking past an ice-cream truck. Let's also say you're on a diet to lose weight and one of the tenants of the diet is to cut down on dairy consumption. One impulse you might have in this situation is to buy an ice-cream cone from the truck at the expense of following your diet. If, however, you wanted to stay on the path to your goal of losing weight, you would HAVE to make your mind perform some work. You inner dialogue might look something like, "no mind, I know that ice-cream looks excellent in this blazingly sticky weather but I've made a commitment to follow my new diet."

The article is written by a gentleman of the name Brian Resnick. Instead of referring to "the author" throughout this piece, I'm just going to say Brian.

The article establishes it's central claim within the fourth paragraph.
> But this idea, that people have self-control because they’re good at willpower, is looking more and more like a myth. It turns out that self-control, and all the benefits from it, may not be related to inhibiting impulses at all. And once we cast aside the idea of willpower, we can better understand what actually works to accomplish goals, and hit those New Year’s resolutions.

The claim, restated, is this: Impulse control, or willpower, is not an effective means by which we can accomplish goals. Brian is going to use the sharpened sword of science to slice through our precious and deeply held misconception that willpower is at the root of all the beneficial changes that we make in our lives and show us what the real key to success is.

Or will he?

The article introduces us to two scientific tests. One test is focused on self-control. It's a test where the user rates themselves on a scale of 1-5 on how well their personal character fits a series of statements. This test is called the "self-control scale". Brian made sure to [link](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download;jsessionid=8ACA1F072F02A260F8AC01CFB37B9EF8?doi=10.1.1.613.6909&rep=rep1&type=pdf) out to it in his article but I will do the same here just for completeness's sake. You can even take the test here if you'd like:
1. I am good at resisting temptation.
2. I have a hard time breaking bad habits.
3. I am lazy.
4. I say inappropriate things.
5. I never allow myself to lose control.
6. I do certain things that are bad for me, if they are fun.
7. People can count on me to keep on schedule.
8. Getting up in the morning is hard for me.
9. I have trouble saying no.
10. I change my mind fairly often.
11. I blurt out whatever is on my mind.
12. People would describe me as impulsive.
13. I refuse things that are bad for me.
14. I spend too much money.
15. I keep everything neat.
16. I am self-indulgent at times.
17. I wish I had more self-discipline.
18. I am reliable.
19. I get carried away by my feelings.
20. I do many things on the spur of the moment.
21. I don’t keep secrets very well.
22. People would say that I have iron self-discipline.
23. I have worked or studied all night at the last minute.
24. I’m not easily discouraged.
25. I’d be better off if I stopped to think before acting.
26. I engage in healthy practices.
27. I eat healthy foods.
28. Pleasure and fun sometimes keep me from getting work done.
29. I have trouble concentrating.
30. I am able to work effectively toward long-term goals.
31. Sometimes I can’t stop myself from doing something, even if I
know it is wrong.
32. I often act without thinking through all the alternatives.
33. I lose my temper too easily.
34. I often interrupt people.
35. I sometimes drink or use drugs to excess.
36. I am always on time.

IDEA: Program a self-control questionnaire and score the user.

What researchers have found is that if you score high on this scale, then you are likely to have success in various aspects of your life. I'm not disputing that result.

The other test is called the Stroop task. It's notorious for being a pain in the brain. The task is to speak the color of a word, not the word itself. What researchers found is that almost everyone sucks at it. Why is it so hard? I can tell you why. When you see the word "red" but the word itself is colored blue, you want to read out loud the word "red". The reason your brain wants to read the word "red" when you know the task is to say the color of the word, which is blue in this case, is because your mind has been trained your whole life to READ WORDS when they appear. You haven't been practicing for years to say the color that a word has when you see it. Tell me, how am I supposed to complete the Stroop task if I don't perform conscious work to act against my impulse to read the word instead of the color!? If willpower wasn't useful in accomplishing the task of reading out the color, then I wouldn't be able to complete the Stroop task.

IDEA: Program a Stroop task generator, present a Stroop task, and score the user!

I fail to see how the results from these two tests show that willpower isn't a useful concept. In fact, I maintain that willpower is the basis for any meaningful change that we'd like to make in our lives.

Alright so let's see what other scientific gold is going to expose the "myth" of willpower. Researchers monitored some students and how often they experienced temptations at a university over the course of a week. Here's what they found:
> The students who exerted more self-control were not more successful in accomplishing their goals. It was the students who experienced fewer temptations overall who were more successful when the researchers checked back in at the end of the semester. What’s more, the people who exercised more effortful self-control also reported feeling more depleted. So not only were they not meeting their goals, they were also exhausted from trying.

Yes, students who find themselves fighting off various temptations like partying, video games, and participating in social clubs where no work ever gets done, are going to be mentally exhausted and feel stressed as they attempt to use their willpower to try and focus on other things that they probably should be doing, like their homework. Those students who don't experience a lot of temptation are going to be more successful since they don't spend a lot of energy thinking about if they should be doing a keg-stand or studying for an upcoming final. I don't dispute this result either. What I'm having trouble understanding is how this result diminishes the utility of willpower. I can tell you that if you want to experience less temptations in your life, willpower is going to be the key. Let's imagine that you are one of these really unfocused students. You go to parties and take any opportunity you can to socialize and find that, as a result, you're falling behind on your assignments. Maybe your goal is to get an A in some math class but with the way you're currently operating, you won't get there. What other option besides using your mind to resist the temptation of drinking beer with your friends on Friday night do you really have? If you're successful at using your willpower to resist that one night, which does take a lot of effort, you might be able to establish a routine where you study for 2 hours on Friday nights instead of hanging with the bros. And once you have a routine established and see your grades improve, the temptation of going out drinking with your buddies will diminish greatly. Now when a researcher comes along to your university to do one of these studies, you'll be amongst those students who experience fewer temptations. If that researcher were to come to your university at a earlier point, before you established your good study habit, you would have been amongst those students in the study who experienced more temptation.

Assertions of the article:
People who self-asses as having more self-control actually do have more self-control. Agreed.
Tests like the 'Stroop task' are accurate measures of people's ability to summon their willpower. Disagree.
People with Self-control are better off in their lives. Agreed. In fact I would argue the more self-control one possesses the better off one is in all aspects of life.
People who have good self-control aren’t necessarily good at inhibiting impulses. Disagree.
It may be the case that your ability to stop being impulsive doesn’t determine how good at self control you are. Disagree.
People who are good at self-control don't experience as many temptations. Agreed.

People who are good at self-control structure their lives so they don't have to make decisions. Structuring your life in such a way requires willpower though. It's easier to follow through with something once it becomes a routine. Duh. How do you establish a routine though? Willpower.

Kids who were best at delaying gratification weren't better at resisting temptation? If they came up with a strategy for changing their perception of the marshmellow then they are better at resisting temptation! Silly contradiction.

Create some code that can generate various Stroop and Flanker tasks (find out what the flanker task is).

Habits, personal preferences, and living in a less tempting environment will certainly help you have more self-control. But to make changes like developing a good habit will require willpower at first.

Point out that beacons of pure willpower like David Goggins would likely fail to perform well on the Stroop task just like everyone else. So is the test a good measure of willpower as we understand it? No.

Some people are genetically more gifted at self-control. Great. Does that mean we throw the idea of willpower out of the window? What about people who've made tremendous changes in their lives. Who were once tempted by bad things but now aren't. How did they accomplish their feats without using willpower?

I think the author is making a mistake because they are treating the concepts of self-control and willpower as separate things. If we break down these two concepts they are really the same. I’ll have to do a detailed break-down.

Failures of inhibition are moral failings. If you fail to resist the temptation of punching your boss in the face when he's saying things that don't make sense, that's a moral failing because instead of resolving the issue through conversation you used violence.

If someone is struggling to maintain a diet, how is this evidence that willpower doesn't work?

We shouldn't blame our ability to summon our own willpower if we gain weight. We should instead blame genetics and our "calorie-laden" environment. What a load of shit.

If you have developed an addiction to cocaine, that is your fault. You have made yourself become chemically dependent by failing to utilize your will to suppress your impulse to party, feel good, and have fun with the help of a drug.

Even the author himself admits the utility of willpower to save yourself from falling back into a bad habit.

Focusing on failures of willpower leads to shame. Yup. Shame is a feeling telling you that you've done something wrong and FORCES you to think about it. Once you experience shame, you can try to understand why you're feeling that way and once you figure that out, you can change your behavior so you don't experience it again.

How does shame hold back our curiosity about self-control and enacting solutions that will help us towards our goals? If you feel shameful about not waking up when your alarm goes off, and as a result you move your alarm across the room so you have to get up to turn it off, wasn't shame the thing that made us think to do that in the first place?

The intention of the article is to cast doubt on the notion that willpower is useful in trying to achieve goals. Why cast doubt on using willpower has a way to drive toward goals though? What's the point? If we claim willpower isn't useful in achieving goals then when we inevitably fail to reach our goals, we don't have to look at ourselves and our weak willpower as a problem. We don't have to look at our inability to summon willpower in the critical moments of our lives as a negative thing because, hey, according to all this research, willpower is just not that important in determining if you achieve the vision you have set out for yourself. What matters is how wealthy we are (largely a function of birth), our environments (if we're in a shitty environment we can't expect ourselves to go towards our goals because our environments going to conspire against us)

I want to impress upon the reader just how nefarious this type of thinking is. Basically if you aren't born wealthy, don't have the right environment, and are born to experience more temptations then the average person, you can pretty much be expected to fail according to all this research. This kind of article gives people an excuse. They can point at it and say look, here's all this evidence that says willpower is overrated.

Use the author's name when describing their thoughts on this matter:
Brian Resnick


How is the article structured?
Central claim: The ability to inhibit/restrain impulses (or "willpower") is not related to self-control and all the benefits that follow from the ability to self-control.

First and second part: Use scientific findings as evidence that willpower isn't what gets people to use self-control.

third part: If it's not willpower driving self-control, what is driving self-control in those who are utilizing it best?

Conclusion: Relying on willpower for a means of achieving goals will only lead to shame and defeat. We have to find something better.

Hey Lisa thanks for your measured response and for taking the time out of your busy life to share your perspective on the matter. I really appreciate it!

I believe you when you say that the special treatment of women in tech get only goes so far. I don't think that men are being thrown completely to the wolves or that women are given insanely preferential treatment to such a degree that they don't have to work at anything, which I know must be a silly and frustrating viewpoint that some men hold that you have to contend with.

You said that the suggestions part of the memo was what you mostly disagreed with. Do you mind explaining which suggestions specifically and for what reasons? I'm not trying to suck you down an endless rabbit hole. This is a topic that's genuinely important to me and I want to stay engaged with someone. I don't think this topic is one that can be fully explored in a just a few Facebook posts, but we can certainly learn a bit more about each other's views on the matter!

You said: "I am in favor of temporarily boosting under-represented groups, because the purpose is to strive for a more equal world.""

I think it's awesome that you want a more equal world where people are more free to do the things that they want without being locked-in to certain domains due to social norms. My question to you is this, however: Do you think that in a 100% fair world, that men and women would still have preferences for certain jobs in different distributions? I tend to think so because it's a matter of hormones, slight differences in sizes between the different parts of women's and men's brains, testosterone, etc. If you disagree with that I'm not offended or think you're stupid or anything. I'd be happy to hear your reasoning.

You cited as evidence of implicit bias your experience with providing answers on slack, and those answers being ignored, only for a man to provide the same answer later and actually get a response. Unfortunately there are people who are probably dismissing your answers because they have a bias going on that they're not aware of. Maybe it's because your a woman. If that's the case that really sucks and I understand why you'd be frustrated. I have a few questions for you to consider, however:
- Is it possible some people are dismissing you because you're young, without it having anything to do with your status as woman? I understand this is a shitty reason to ignore someone still, but maybe it doesn't have to do with your sex.
- Is it also possible that you think you've provided the same answer as someone else, but you missed an important detail in your answer that someone else covered in their answer? I'm NOT accusing you of not being able to distinguish between the answers and I'm not saying that your ability to assess them as the same answer is poor, but we're all human and can jump to conclusions if we feel we've been wronged. I know that I've THOUGHT that someone was ignoring an answer that I provided, only to have someone else provide that same answer, but when I reflected on the situation, I realized that I didn't quite answer the question in the same way and with the same information as the other person and that explained why I was ignored.

I totally believe that some people are ignoring you because you're a woman too, which is horrible. I'm just trying to give you some things to ponder about.

You said that you want to get society to a point where it doesn't feel "unusual" to have a female engineer. I'm afraid I've accepted the reality that it will always feel a bit unusual to see one woman amongst a group of ten or so guys. That being said, I hope they treat her as an equal member of the team insofar as one can do that, considering everyone has different skills and strengths.

You also said: "I think that itâ€™s in software's best idea to have a diverse team working on it. Because of on average differences between genders, I think that diversity ultimately makes for a better product in many cases."

I totally agree! A diverse set of people will bring a diverse set of perspectives which can be leveraged to ultimately improve a product.

You also pointed out that despite efforts to push for diversity, only 7/42 of the TLPs in our class were female. What does that say about the effectiveness of a policy that chases a 50/50 split? I'm not saying to give up on trying to recruit more women into tech, I'm just questioning whether a 50/50 split is a reasonable or even an obtainable goal given the differences in interests between men and women.

I don't believe that you were chosen purely for your gender. You are a very smart woman who is going to be very successful because of your strong character and genuine effort! It pains me that some men will look at a woman engineer and think to themselves, "that woman is only here because of her vagina," without even looking into her merits. That's shitty behavior and I hope it stops.

I'm also sorry to hear that you feel like you have to overachieve just to prove to others who are small minded that woman can be capable in a tech role. To be honest, those types of people may who think that women should always constantly prove their worth may be hopeless causes and I would suggest that the best thing you can probably do is let them know how you feel about it, but then not stress over it too much. Again, just a suggestion, take it or leave it, I respect your decisions.

You said: We should all empower each other, rather than being jealous of the various advantages each of us gets for various traits.

Here, here! I agree for the most part, although we have to be careful about how we're empowering each other. If we imagine a scenario where I'm in the midst of a bunch of women who think James Damore is douche contributing to bias against women (I'm certainly not saying James is viewed as douche by all women), I may empower the women in that group by agreeing with their consensus but I would disempower myself by lying about my actual thoughts on the matter.

Again, thanks for taking the time reason with me. Respond if you'd like, there's no pressure, and I won't think less of you if you feel like that would be a waste of time. I just like to go deep into topics to try and understand why people think the way that they do.

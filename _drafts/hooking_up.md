While I appreciate that the author and her fellow women are waking up to the idea that having sex without any emotional attachment to their partners is likely to lead to disappointment in their personal emotional lives, there's a number of things in this article that I'd like to address.

## Good Things


> But my internal life was characterized by paralyzing anxiety and depression. I judged myself harshly, to the point of disgust. I drove myself to excessive exercising and near-anorexia. I felt this way because of men--or so I thought.

I'm very glad that Leah seems to have identified that men aren't the ones responsible for her feelings of anxiety and depression.

> I told myself that I was a feminist, despite subjecting myself to unfulfilling, emotionally damaging sexual experiences. And I believed it, too.



## Criticism
> Pleasure-centric sex ed might even reduce sexual assault and encourage more students to report it, as both women and men armed with a clear understanding of how sex ought to feel would more easily distinguish between assault and "bad sex".

I agree that if more women were honest about and acknowledged their need to feel emotional attachment for sex to be enjoyable, that there'd be a lot less bad sex going around. It's seems to me, however, that Leah is also suggesting that if the woman isn't emotionally "feeling it" that we might want to classify things that were, at one time, considered "bad sex" as sexual assault. This is disturbing to me because how the hell is any young anxious college guy supposed to "earn his wings" if, during sex, he'd have to constantly think about if the woman is "emotionally invested" in the act, and if she isn't, then he risks getting accused of assault? If a guy and a girl have sex and later she feels regret about it, has the man "assaulted" her? I think this territory is much more subtle and we should be very careful about how we determine if something is sexual assault or not.

> I'm also a white, straight, cisgendered female. If you're thinking, "Please. Your privileged ass has nothing to complain about," you're right.

The newest annoying trend seems to be for authors to acknowledge that they're so privileged that they have no right to complain, but to complain regardless. Who cares if you're white. Get to the point and start fleshing out what your problem is.

> I soon came to believe that real relationships were impossible at Midd.

Ah yes because your first attempts at establishing a relationship in college didn't work out, that means real relationships between others at the college aren't possible. This is the narcissism of the perfectionist at work: "If I can't do it, no one can."

> I convinced myself myself I didn't want one anyway.

Ah yes. Convinced that if a perfect person like yourself couldn't get into a meaningful relationship, it was pointless to pursue one anyway, and that's not what you wanted to begin with, even though you did.

> I wished I that I could be like the guys, who seemed not to care at all. Months after things had ended between us, Ben said, "I didn't think of you as a human being while we were hooking up."

I'm skeptical. This is the same guy who you watched Netflix with,

## Questions
> Two students consistently hook up with one another--and typically, only each other--for weeks, months, even years. Yet per unspoken social code, neither party is permitted emotional involvement, commitment, or vulnerability. To call them exclusive would be "clingy," or even "crazy."

This is a typical situation. A guy and a girl hookup. They get comfortable with each other, so they continue to hookup. Leah is suggesting, however, that the reason their relationship doesn't proceed forward to be meaningful is due to the "unspoken social code" whereby no one wants to take the risk of making the relationship exclusive. She suggests that if she were to express that she'd like to make the relationship more meaningful, that'd she'd get called "clingy" or "crazy" by her hookup partner.

Here's a question for you ladies to ponder: If a guy that you hookup with on the regular isn't showing any signs of investing effort into getting to know you better, is it only because he's been socialized that way and doesn't want to break "the bro code"? Maybe he's fine with having sex and doesn't worry about how you're going to think about yourself after he leaves. Maybe he's just exploring his options and doesn't want to get involved with someone to the point where he's investing a lot of his time, energy and emotion into something that likely won't work out. Guys aren't dumb. We're aware that just because two people have sex, that they aren't destined to form a deep emotional connection in a future relationship.

> I wasn't just the social pressure that drove me to buy into the commitment-free hookup lifestyle, but my own identity as a feminist.

If there are any ladies who can answer this question for me, I'd be grateful if you took the time to enlighten me here. I'm curious to know, what kind of "social pressure" are you experiencing where you are driven to engage in the hookup culture that you find so empty? Is it dirty looks, whispers, and lectures from your feminist friends? I'm confused because some women constantly complain about how there's pressure to NOT engage in hookup culture because if they do, they'll be labeled "SLUTS".

> Kelsey reported trying "traditional" hookup culture after after a relationship ended, sleeping with various guys as liberated experimentation. "I had "


# Finally
I think it's great that women are questioning whether or not sex without commitment is actually good for them. If you have sex but feel that your partner hasn't really invested time into caring about you on a deeper emotional level, I can totally understand how that could leave one feeling empty and how it could affect the pleasurable aspects of sex for a woman.

I've got a small criticism of the article, however. Leah said, "Pleasure-centric sex ed might even reduce sexual assault and encourage more students to report it, as both women and men armed with a clear understanding of how sex ought to feel would more easily distinguish between assault and 'bad sex'."

I agree that if more women were honest about and acknowledged their need to feel emotional attachment for sex to be enjoyable, that there'd be a lot less bad sex going around. It's seems to me, however, that Leah is also suggesting that if the woman isn't emotionally "feeling it" that we might want to classify things that were, at one time, considered "bad sex" as sexual assault. This is disturbing to me because how the hell is any young anxious college guy supposed to "earn his wings" if, during sex, he'd have to constantly think about if the woman is "emotionally invested" in the act, and if she isn't, then he risks getting accused of assault? If a guy and a girl have sex and later she feels regret about it, has the man "assaulted" her? I think this territory is much more subtle and we should be very careful about how we determine if something is sexual assault or not.

Besides that, I think the article was a very good piece of reflection on Leah's part. I'm very happy that she came to the realization that she wasn't following her true desires because she wanted to stay true to the ideals of what she thought was feminism and realized that hooking up wasn't the way she was going to personally feel fulfilled in her life. She came to the realization that chasing dick, motivated by a desire to be "a feminist", lead to sex that wasn't satisfying for her and lead to a lot of anxious behavior. I wish her the best of luck in finding herself in a relationship where she feels emotionally supported and fulfilled.

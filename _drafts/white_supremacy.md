I try to see all sides to a story.
I listen to racist jokes and laugh at them, It's just a joke!
I remain apolitical.
I don't prioritize the work involved in determining if every member of my family is racist so that I can then call them out on it.
I see nothing wrong with the phrases "Why can't we all just get along?" and "We all belong to the human race."
I strive to see people for their character not their race, in other words I try to be "colorblind."
I culturally appropriate everything I think is useful.

According to this pyramid, I'm a pretty solid brick sitting at the base of white supremacy. According to this pyramid, I'm indifferent, I minimize the experiences of others, and I'm a veiled racist. And do you know what's really sinister? According to this pyramid, I'm WORSE than a guy marching down the street screaming about "the nasty black folk." Why? Because, according to this pyramid, my behaviors are at the foundation of white supremacy. I'm a conspirator and a collaborator of white supremacy. According to this pyramid, if the people around me and I were to change our problematic behaviors then all the bad shit at the top would just tumble down and there'd be no more white supremacy.

There certainly remain social injustices in the U.S. and the world, but if this pyramid was created in an attempt to help fix racist/problematic behavior, I'm afraid it's doing the opposite of what the authors of it intended. A graphic like this is only going to drive reasonable people further away from social justice, because they will see how ridiculous the pyramid is.

This is not a good way to recruit people to your cause.

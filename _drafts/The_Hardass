# The Hard-ass
1. Explain a typical scenario where I'm being a hard-ass with a student.
  * Ask them to read something out of the book, what they think of it, how they can pull understanding out of it
  * Ask them what they think a concept means
  * Ask them to draw on the whiteboard
  * Ask them to go back in their notes
  * Ask them how do they know if their answer is correct
  * Exposing lies in an unflattering manner
  * Questioning your understanding directly

Explain what I do if students start complaining.
* This instructor sucks
* the book is too hard
* I don't learn well this way
* I don't get it
* I'm too dumb

I make people uncomfortable. Things students have said.
* "You make me a little nervous when you look me in the eyes."
* "You're a little aggressive."
* "You're so serious."
* "You seem angry."

2. The results of being a hard-ass
  * Some students get it, work hard, and make immense improvements.
  * Some students get offended and immediately leave.
  * Some students seek out someone else who is going to have a more laid back style with them.
  * Some students run off to find a tutor who will give them all the answers.

3. Explain why I do it. Why it's important that I make people a little uncomfortable and why it's important that I make you do the work.

I walk into the tutor room for my 1pm shift at 12:30. It's a Friday. There's about 8 students sitting there. Some are muttering to themselves, sitting away from the others. Some are laughing with each other and goofing around. Some are helping their friends out and I can hear someone saying, "No your array needs to be size 10 not 9..." As I walk in, eager eyes look to me. I ignore them and take a seat. Some of the students know me well. Others are faces I'm seeing for the first time. The whiteboard is filthy. It hasn't been cleaned since the last time I've been in this room. There are books scattered everywhere. Bits of broken off pencil lead lie all over the floor and on the table and they've been rolling around from people stepping on them or laying their arms on them, creating streaks of lead all over. There are gloves, sunglasses, pencil sharpeners and various odds and ends located in a corner of the room in a makeshift lost and found pile. I swear and mutter quietly to myself under my breath, "lazy...unorganized...fucking...mess...," as I being spraying the whiteboard down with cleaner and pressing a paper towel into the board while making furious circular motions. I'm angry but at the same time I secretly love the suck-fest I'm about to put myself and these students through. I start to gather up the books when I hear movement at the door. Quiet feet that have stopped just shy of coming into the room. I wheel around and there's a student craning their neck into the room and looking around, not quite sure if they've arrived at the right spot. I greet them, "Hi there, you must be a student looking for help with computer science?" The student looks a little more relieved and their shoulders drop a little, "Yes, I'm actually looking for help with Computer Science I". "Alright I'll be helping you when my shift starts at 1pm," I say. The student notices someone they know in the room and takes a seat next to them. I sit down and open my Computer Science I book. From all the discussion I can overhear, I know which problem they're all struggling with. I'm become very familiar with the book by this point. I turn the page with the problem, and re-read the task that they've been assigned so that I know what kind of questions to expect from students and what the proper answers are. I can feel eyes on my back. Occasionally, just for a bit of Machiavellian fun, I look up into the eyes of students throwing anxious glances at me and they quickly avert their eyes and bury their noses back into their books. A student walks over to me and says, "uummm, can I get some help?" I turn to them in my chair, "Yes, I will be helping you at 1pm when my shift starts. In the meantime I'm studying up on your problem so that I'm equipped to answer any question you have properly. Thanks." The student sits back down with a bit of a grunt. 12:55pm. I stand up in front the whiteboard, now bleach white. "Alright folks. There's a lot of people in here right now and this can be pretty tough assignment for some so I'm going to try and do my best to visit you all and give you equal time with me so we can get through this assignment together. Forgive me if you feel like I'm not spending enough time with you but I'll be doing my best." I'm setting the tone. The assignment is due at midnight, and as usual, there are a bunch of students who underestimated how much work the assignment would be and they are now sitting here and some of them are beginning to panic. Some are barely hanging on to that 'C' and are struggling weekly. Some are good students but they also have a perfection complex that makes them break into a sweat when they think about not getting a 'A' for the 50th time in a row. Some are surly and bitter. Some are go-getters. Some are goofballs. Some I've worked with before and they like me. Some I've worked with before and they don't like me. Some are new and don't know what they're about to get themselves into. It's the middle of the semester, which is a critical time because it's starting come to that point where those who are behind are really going to start feeling the pain in the upcoming weeks.

# Sit Rep
Sometimes a somewhat complete and concise review of one’s situation is in order. One could call this type of review a “situation report” or “sit rep” for short. I am not following an already established format for this sit rep, although I am sure there are many good templates to choose from, as I have developed my own. The sections are “The Bad”, “The Good”, and “Planned Actions”.
“The Bad” section is intended to be a hard and candid look at what’s not going well in my life. It will be attempt at getting a handle on the problems that are proving to be quite “sticky,” in the sense that they are both persistent and messy.
“The Good” section is intended to be a purposeful acknowledgement of what is going well and things I should continue doing.
“Planned Actions” are activities that I should take up or drop based on what I summarize about the first two sections.

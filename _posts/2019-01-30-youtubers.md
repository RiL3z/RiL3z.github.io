I've been rather introspective lately so I figured I'd take a break from that and take the time to proselytize about some of my favorite YouTube channels. I think all these channels have had a profound impact on me as I've watched them over the years because I find them to be inspiring and insightful in their own meaningful ways.

Juji is a crazy. I can't tell if his partner in crime, Tom, is crazier for choosing to follow him all over the place, documenting his fitness journey, however. These two go to any lengths necessary to meet up with fellow fitness freaks of all sorts. Rock climbers, grip gurus, world record holding strongmen, etc. But he's also a man of the people. He'll set up a grip challenge in the middle of the mall and ask folks to try it out. It's hilarious and wildly entertaining often because of Juji's, Tom's, and their guest's contrasting personalities. It's a perfect yin and yang. I love this channel too because despite all the antics done in the name of entertainment, these two are not afraid to sit down and do some serious reflection on their work, what they've learned, and how they could grow to become better people. They aren't afraid of admitting that there are a lot of big egos in fitness (including their own) and that can give people a false impression of what the fitness industry is like.

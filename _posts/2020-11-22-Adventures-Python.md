# Adventures in Python
I'm trying to learn python because it might come in handy to know at some point in the future. The way I'm learning is by using this [online python interpreter]( https://www.tutorialspoint.com/execute_python3_online.php) along with [this tutorial](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/tutorial).

### To Begin With
Every programming tutorial conventionally starts with the "Hello, World!" program. Here it is in Python:  
**Program:**
```python3
print ("Hello World!");
```
**Output:**
```
Hello World!
```
Makes sense so far. So, the next thing you might wonder is how do we assign a value to a variable in Python? It is quite simple, here's an example of assigning the literal string value of `"Hello World!"` to a variable called `testVar`: `testVar = "Hello World!"`.  
The next thing to learn is how to operate with values. Here's an example of that:  
**Program:**
```python3
print(5 + 8)
print("14" + " the string")
print(13//2)
print(9756 % 10)
print(2 ** 3)
```
**Output:**
```
13
14 the string
6
6
8
```
What's interesting to note is that Python has native operators for floor division (`\\`) and exponents (`**`), which I think is quite nice, because we don't have to go running off writing our own functions for these operations.

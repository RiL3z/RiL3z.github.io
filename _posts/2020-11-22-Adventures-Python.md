# Adventures in Python
I'm trying to learn python because it might come in handy to know at some point in the future. The way I'm learning is by using this [online python interpreter]( https://www.tutorialspoint.com/execute_python3_online.php) along with [this tutorial](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/tutorial).

### To Begin With
Every programming tutorial conventionally starts with the "Hello, World!" program. Here it is in Python: 
**Program**
```python3
print ("Hello World!");
```
**Output**:
```
Hello World!
```
Makes sense so far. So, the next thing you might wonder is how do we assign a value to a variable in Python? It is quite simple, here's an example of assigning the literal string value of `"Hello World!"` to a variable called `testVar`: `testVar = "Hello World!"`.

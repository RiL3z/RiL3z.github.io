I think it would be wise for me to get a better handle on the go programming language.  I've used it somewhat in the past, but that use was mostly small code changes to an existing application.  A deeper dive would probably benefit me!  The way I like to learn a new programming language is through small bite-sized experiments, and the official go website allows us to experiment with go without even having to install anything on our system!  I'll be taking the tour route: https://tour.golang.org/  
Here's our first program:
```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	fmt.Println("Hello, world!")
}
```
And here's the output:
```
Hello, world!
```

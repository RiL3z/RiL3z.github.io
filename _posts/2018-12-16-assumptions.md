# Life Without God

I'm an atheist. Few of my friends like to talk about it. Many people know this about me but they don't seem to have a lot of curiosity about it, or if they do, they're afraid to talk to me about it, or they simply don't have the time or want to put in the effort it would take to argue with me about it. I understand that. My stamina for debate and discussion usually exhausts most foes. Over years of reading, writing, and observing discussions, I can confidently say that I know what the most common misconceptions about me due to my atheism are. My purpose here is to address those misconceptions and show why they are just that. Misconceptions.

Prepare to get **PISSED**.

## What I Believe About God
First, I'd like to establish here what my actual beliefs are about God without **ANY** confusion. This set of beliefs is quite simple and can be summarized like this:
- **God doesn't exist**. There is no higher power besides the laws of the universe that we can observe and have yet to discover. God cannot actively intervene in people's lives. He cannot bestow blessings upon the few fortunate enough to win his favor and he cannot damn the others unfortunate enough to incur his wrath.
- There's no after-life. There's no purgatory, heaven or hell. You will not get punished for your wrong-doing, rewarded for you virtue, or await judgement in the after-life. Once you die you're gone for good. That means you have **ONE** experience of life to enjoy. Make it count.

I won't spend much time justifying how I came to believe these things because that would require a book to explain. I will, however, say that I came down this road mainly because of questions. If you're at all inclined, here's a few I'd recommend you ask.
- Where did the universe come from? Is God the only plausible explanation?
- How does God judge good and bad actions?
- If God works in mysterious ways, and we can't know his mind, how can we know that God will send someone like Osama Bin Laden to hell?
- Is it fair that God judges us by some criteria that only he knows? Would it be fair for a teacher to assign you a grade in a class without making the rubric available for you to see? If it's fair for God to do it but not your teacher, why?

There's also lots of good Youtube videos on the subject. [TheraminTrees](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJ-vHE5CrGaL_ITEg-n3OeA) does one of the best jobs [breaking things down](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YQfsyK9ois).

## "You Don't Really Believe That," said the Doofus
The first frustrating question that I have to contend with goes something like this:

> Isn't it hard to find purpose or meaning in life without believing in a higher power?

Obviously not. If you know anything about me you will know that I find a great deal of meaning in life without God. Kissing a beautiful girl, taking a hike in the woods, and listening to good music doesn't lose any of it's meaning because I don't believe in God. I am capable of appreciating these moments just as well as any other human.

Here's another one of my favorites:

> If there's no reward of an after-life, why be good?

This one is easy to address. I try my hardest to be good because being good to people feels good. I feel good about myself after I take the time to sit down with an intern at work and help them work through a tough engineering problem. Why does that feel good? Because I know that I've taught them a little more independence, that they've gained a little more confidence, and I've helped them believe a little more than they did before our session that they are smart and they are capable of figuring things out. I want people to be the best version of themselves and if I can help them do some of that, I feel fucking amazing. Imagine what the world could be like if everyone put their best foot forward all the time? That vision of the world drives me to want to help. I'm not interested in a reward for my good deeds after death. I am interested in doing what I can now to make my immediate surroundings better than they were yesterday. I am not a dog who needs to be rewarded with the treat of heaven in order to behave.

> You can't make moral judgements without God.

Another easy one to dismiss. Murder is bad because taking away someone else's opportunity to experience the joys and pains of life is cruel and creates suffering. Look at this guy over here, making moral judgements without God. Who does he think he is? Next.

> You're mad at God.

Sure. I'm mad at God like just I'm mad at the murderous jigglypuff that hides in the closet of every house whose street number is odd.

> You believe God exists and just say you're an atheist for the reaction.

Yup. You know me. King of hipsters and master contrarian. I will admit, I do enjoy ticking people off sometimes, but I don't form my beliefs around the goal of making people angry. I try to observe reality as best I can, see where my beliefs land according to that, and if my beliefs frustrate some folks, that's fine.

> Surely, you must believe in something greater than yourself.

I believe in making myself into the most disciplined, badass, relentless, and driven motherfucker you have ever met. I have decided that pursuing that goal is the best way I can contribute to humanity.

> You must think you're smarter than religious people.

No. There are many religious folks with minds more formidable than mine. Making assumptions that I think I'm smarter than everyone else is pretty dumb though.

> Aren't you afraid of hell?

I'm more afraid of getting gored by a unicorn ridden by a leprechaun who wants to tie me up and fuck me than I am of hell.

> I'm worried about you!

I know you want the best for me but I'm not going to change a fundamental part of who I am because you're worried. Sorry if that seems harsh but sticking to my principles and values is more important to me than making you feel better about my prospects of getting into heaven. Accuse me of cruelty and narcissism if it makes you feel better.

> What if you're wrong?

Ah [Pascal's wager](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZpJ7yUPwdU). Such a lovely concept.  
I'm open to the idea that I might be wrong about God's existence even though I don't think it's very likely. I hope I'm wrong. I hope I stand before the immense wisdom and power of God after I've lived a long, glorious life, and he condemns me to hell. At least then I'll know what kind of creator we've all been living under. But, I can hear you exclaim, "You don't know what you're agreeing to! An eternity of suffering!" This is usually the point in the discussion where the vein in my neck starts becoming noticeable. I'm an adult. When I agree to something, I'm aware of potential the consequences of that agreement. I know exactly what I'm agreeing to by not believing in God. So be it.

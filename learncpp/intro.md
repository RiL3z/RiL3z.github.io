# Computer Programming
Are you interested in harnessing the awesome power of computers for your own nefarious ends? If so, then one of the fundamental things you must learn is how to control the computer. We can achieve a very fine level of control over the computer if we learn how to speak in it's language. We must learn how to program.

## What You Will Learn
If you absorb the lessons of this book you will be able to:
- Understand problems.
- Come up with solutions to problems.
- Be able to instruct computers to solve problems.
- Comprehend computer code that others have written.
- Read dense, technical oriented text and extract from it understanding.

## Who This Book Is For
This book is a selfish book. I wrote it for myself, mainly. It's my own reflection on learning a programming language from scratch. That being said, this book is also for anyone who:
- Wants to understand computer programming on a deep level.
- Isn't satisfied with their current understanding of the subject.
- Wants to destroy their competitors in the job market when it comes to technical competency.
- Wants to be smarter.
- Wants to understand how to think computationally and how to harness computers for their own ends.
- Wants to understand how to read books to truly understand their contents.

If you want these things then you are probably going to get something out of this book.

This book is also clearly not for certain people. If you:
- Know it all.
- Are faint of heart.
- Are of weak conviction that computers are an important part of functioning society.
- Are easily offended by swearing and crude jokes.
- Quit at something at the first sign of resistance.
- Think that certain people are born into engineering and not forged.
- Overvalue a nice teacher.

Then you are probably going to have a difficult time learning from this book.

## The Style Of This Book
I've written this book while imagining the following scenario: I'm an experienced teacher who is trying to teach a student who is completely clueless about computer programming. So in some sense I'm writing this from two very different perspectives. I've been programming for a number of years and I can operate effectively in a number of different programming languages. I also have extensive teaching experience in computer science so my problem solving skills are fundamentally solid and I can anticipate where most confusion for green students trying to understand complex topics will come from. So one perspective I possess is of the surly old veteran who is confident and competent in his ability to understand the details of computers enough that he can architect and build his own solutions to problems that lend themselves to computation (which is almost all problems). On the other hand, programming languages like C and C++ are not my strong suit, I must admit. They operate on the computer at level slightly lower than what I'm used to with other languages like python, ruby, java, etc. So in order to prevent myself from letting any habitual patterns of thinking I've learned over the years get in the way of my learning, I'm also approaching learning this language as if I know not a damn thing. In this book I am trying to channel both the omniscient sage and the careless fool.

## What I Believe
A have a number of fundamental beliefs about teaching and learning and those beliefs form the bedrock of this whole book. If you do not share these beliefs with me than learning from me is going to be difficult.
- You want to become a master. "Good enough" won't cut it. If you only desire enough knowledge to write passable computer code that will see you through most problems you'll face in your career then you will find my book to be, among other things, overly indulgent, boring and unnecessarily cruel.
- Learning is difficult. There are no short-cuts. Learning involves repetition and memorization, but also it involves changing the way you think. Learning requires a shift in thought. It requires modifying your mind.
- We should know exactly what we're talking about, and when we don't we should admit that we don't. When we use words we should have a very clear idea of what they mean. This will require a level of focus and an attention to detail you might not be used to and might find exhausting at first. My advice for you, should this book become exhausting, is to learn how to gain mental strength from the struggle. Do you become bogged down and less focused as the details come in, or do become more curious and engaged the more detail you're given to scrutinize over? If you sound like the former rather than the later, this book will be a challenge. But perhaps it's exactly the kind of challenge you need.
- You should want to learn as much as you can. Of course we have to place limits on what we can focus on learning at first because if we don't, we'll end up down rabbit holes that never seem to end. Your hunger to learn more should never diminish, however.
- Struggle is part of the process. Frustration, anger, fear, and doubt are all normal parts of the learning process. If you aren't feeling these things when you try to learn something new you aren't being challenged.
